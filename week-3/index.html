			<p>Chicken curry is a simple dish made of chicken pieces and spices. The aromas and flavors are a delight to the senses and linger through the taste buds. Chicken curry is best served with fresh Naan bread or plain rice or flavored rice like fried rice and pulaos. There are endless variations to the chicken curry and can be prepared using different spices to give different exotic flavors and taste. A basic chicken curry is made with chicken cooked with chili powder, ginger, garlic, coriander powder and fresh garam masala (cardamom, cinnamon and cloves). The other major ingredients which can be added to the chicken curry are the cashew nut (kaju) paste, coconut milk or badam (almond) paste. The spice level of the curry is high due to the use of black pepper and chilli powder. But the blending of cashew nut paste with the spices offsets the spicy flavor of the curry and gives this dish its unmistakable, not-too-rich, subtly sweet, warm and spicy flavor. A curry is a generic description used throughout Western cultures to describe a variety of spiced dishes especially from South India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thai or other South and Southeast Asian cuisines. The Three most popular spices used most as curry powders are turmeric, coriander, and cumin. A wide range of additional spices may also be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (meats, fish, lentils, rice, etc. The word "curry" is analogous to "soup" or "stew" in that there is no particular ingredient that makes something "curry." Curry's popularity in recent decades has spread throughout the Indian subcontinent to figure prominently in international cuisine. Consequently, each culture has adopted spices in its indigenous cooking to suit its own unique tastes and cultural sensibilities. Curry can therefore be called a pan-Asian or global phenomenon with immense popularity in Thai, British, Japanese and Jamaican cuisines. Chicken curry is a common Punjabi cuisine dish popular in South Asia especially in India and Pakistan, Bangladesh, East Asia as well as in UK, Canada and the Caribbean. Traditionally a chicken curry consists of chicken cooked with onion, tomato or yoghurt based sauce flavored with ginger and garlic, chillies and a variety of spices. To prepare this simple yet yummy and delicious Chicken curry, firstly remove the skin portion from the chicken then wash it the chicken thoroughly four to five time. Peel the skin off the onions and chop them finely. Shred the garlic into very fine pieces and mash or cut the ginger. Grind the whole cinnamon and cardamom (with shells) together to a coarse powder. Pour required oil to just cover the base of a dry medium to large saucepan and heat until the oil is very hot but not smoky. Add the garlic pieces and chopped onions in the hot oil and fry well. Fry until the onions get golden brown. Remove the saucepan from the heat and leave to stand. Place all the spices like turmeric, cumin and chilli powder into a small cereal bowl. Add about half a cup of water and mix. Pour the spice mixture into the onions. Fry on a medium heat until most of the water evaporates but ensures that the spice mixture does not burn. Add the chicken and stir until all the chicken is well coated with the spice mixture. Reduce to low heat. Add salt to taste, chopped tomatoes and ginger and cook for about 10-15 minutes. Then add enough water to just cover the chicken. Place a lid on the saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce to medium heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Add the cardamom/ cinnamon powder just 10 minutes before the chicken is served. The Chicken curry is ready to be served straight away but would taste even better the next day. Start the recipe as said above but add the chicken first into the onions, then the spices directly into the chicken followed by tomato, ginger and salt. Stir vigorously for 5 minutes on a high heat and add enough water to cover the chicken. The curry is ready in 30 minutes. Do try this recipe and you will find that it is very simple and easy to prepare.
